I am a postdoctoral researcher at POSTECH Institute of Artificial Intelligence. I received \\
my Ph.D. degree at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), where I\\
was advised by Prof. Hwanjo Yu. My research interests include machine learning for\\
real-world systems (e.g., knowledge distillation, recommender systems) and trustworthy AI\\
(e.g., confidence calibration, unbiased learning).
